HAVE A QUESTION?


WHAT CAN A 10X20 STORAGE UNIT HOLD IN SAINT JOHN?

A 10 x20 storage unit is around the size of a single car garage. We recommend this size for more significant self-storage needs,
like freeing up space to stage your home, during a remodel or in between moves.


WHAT CAN A 10X10 UNIT HOLD IN SAINT JOHN?

A 10×10 is about half the size of a standard garage. With the capacity to hold a king-sized bed, larger bedroom furniture, and
oh-so-many boxes, the options for this unit are expansive .


WHAT CAN A 5X5 UNIT HOLD IN SAINT JOHN?

A 5×5 is about the size of a walk in closet. While it’s small enough to easily manage household clutter, seasonal decor, and
boxes, it’s also great for appliances, small furniture, and odd shapes like camping gear or sports equipment. Think of it like a
walk-in closet that isn’t attached to your bedroom.


WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO RENT A STORAGE UNIT IN SAINT JOHN?

T o rent a storage unit with Mini Mall Storage, you’ll need a valid form of government-issued ID, such as a driver’s license,
passport, or provincial ID.


WHAT ITEMS AM I NOT ALLOWED TO STORE IN A STORAGE UNIT IN SAINT JOHN?

We do not allow tenants to store stolen or illegal goods in our storage units. Additionally, we disallow flammable or hazardous
items, combustible items or liquids, plants, perishable goods, or animals. For additional and more specific information about what
you cannot store, please contact us .


WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF DRIVE-UP ACCESS STORAGE UNITS IN SAINT JOHN?

Drive-up storage units allow tenants to drive up to, load, and unload their storage unit. This is especially useful for
transporting large items. Drive-up storage units are tall, convenient, and located on the ground floor so that you don’t have to
navigate stairs or elevators.


DO I NEED INSURANCE FOR A STORAGE UNIT IN SAINT JOHN?

Absolutely! It’s important to us that your belongings are protected. Therefore, we require all tenants to hold a valid insurance
policy. Get covered with your own insurance plan and provide proof of coverage with your policy number, coverage overview, start
date, and expiry date. Alternatively, we offer tenants coverage through our Mini Mall Storage Protection Plan. This provides
$5,000 in coverage for $19.95 plus tax, charged on the first of each month, hassle-free with your usual bill. Speak to your
Storage Concierge Specialist to learn more.

Covered Parking

Parking spaces and covered vehicle storage for your car, boat, or RV can keep your ride from consuming valuable space in your
garage, all while shielding it from the elements—like sunshine, rain, or hail. Some of our covered parking units even include
electricity, too. Find and contact a self storage facility near you for location-specific car storage availability.
